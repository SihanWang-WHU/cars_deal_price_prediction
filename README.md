# Car Deals Price Prediction

Welcome to the Car Deals Price Prediction repository. This project is dedicated to building a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of used cars based on historical sales data. Utilizing a range of Python libraries and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights for potential buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and ingestion.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For various machine learning models, data preprocessing, and performance metrics.
- **LightGBM** and **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting frameworks used to build predictive models.
- **Keras** with **TensorFlow** backend: For designing and training deep neural network models.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing and additional statistics capabilities.

## Project Overview

The Car Deals Price Prediction model takes into account various features of a car listing, such as the make and model, registration date, vehicle type, mileage, and many others, including anonymous features that have been provided in the dataset. The dataset comprises multiple attributes that describe the characteristics and condition of used cars.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. It involves:
- Reducing memory usage by optimizing data types.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Extracting date-related features.
- Binning numerical features and creating interaction terms.

## Feature Engineering

The feature engineering process enhances the predictive power of the model by:
- Encoding categorical variables using techniques like mean encoding, target encoding, and count encoding.
- Generating new features from existing ones to expose the underlying patterns to the machine learning algorithms.

## Model Training and Evaluation

We employ several regression models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and XGBoost, along with a deep neural network model to predict used car prices. The models are trained using KFold cross-validation to ensure generalization across different subsets of data. Model performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.

## Results

The final output is a predictive model that takes a car's features as input and outputs a predicted sale price. The model's performance is detailed in the training logs with losses and MAE for both training and validation sets.
